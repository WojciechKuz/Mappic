# Mappic 🌎🌍🌏
This will be an app in which you can use photos as maps. How? Just take a photo of map or plan (i.e. map of old town, plan of building, etc.),
mark two points with location provided and using your GPS app will be able to determine, where are you on a plan.
It can be useful in places, where you don't have access to online maps or you want to have more detailed map.

Mappic is still in development though
